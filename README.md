# Weather Server Client Application

This project implements a weather client-server application. The client addresses the server with indication: country and city. The server, upon receiving a request, returns the weather for the day for a given area. To implement the application, multithreading mechanisms were used.

To do this, use the site https://openweathermap.org.
After a request from a client, we need to get weather data from this source. Return the result to the client.

# You can run this project locally just do:

1. Make a clone of the repository https://github.com/Deker39/weather-server-client-application.git
2. Install to librery whose you dosen't have
3. Open a console and write  `python server_weather.py` 
4. After open new console and write  `python client_weather_one.py`
