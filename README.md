# weather-server-client-application

This project implements a weather client-server application. The client addresses the server with indication: country and city. The server, upon receiving a request, returns the weather for the day for a given area. To implement the application, multithreading mechanisms were used.

To do this, use the site https://openweathermap.org.
After a request from a client, we need to get weather data from this source. Return the result to the client.
